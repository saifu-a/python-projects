# Mapping

This is Python program to display a World Map with specific locations marked with markers. This program uses the Folium Python library to create the maps. The map can be accessed via the '.html' file. The locations of the volcanoes are imported from the 'Volcanoes.txt' file. The Population data is extracted from the 'world.json' file.

### To Install Folium use the following command
