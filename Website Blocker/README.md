# Website Blocker

This is a Python script that will block certain websites for a specific period of time of the day. The scripts targets the 'hosts' file of the system to perform the task. Further improvement can be made if the list of the websites to be blocked come from a file.

To make the script work you have to have administrative privilages.

Change the file extension to '.pyw' from '.py'
